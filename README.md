# Revisor 

**Revisor** is a simple app designed to keeping track of tasks to review and revise.

# Motivation
Itâ€™s not easy for someone like me to remember things for a long time, we tend to forget them after a few days. To retain information, you need to revise it after some time. Thatâ€™s where Revisor will help you. It will determine which task you should revise first based on several parameters, such as the last day you revised it, the taskâ€™s difficulty, and the number of times you have already revised it.

It helps you manage a list of tasks that you are progressively completing one by one, while also setting aside time to revise old tasks. 

Currently, it primarily focuses on revising DSA questions.
